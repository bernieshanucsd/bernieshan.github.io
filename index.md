## Best Quote from CSE Department

As many of the professors here in the CSE departments say:
> Start early, Start often.

Hence, I am working on this lab many days before it is actually due.

## My first ever coding assignment

Here is my fist coding assignment I did back in high school called Hello World!

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This site was built for my [CSE 110](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse110) class.
